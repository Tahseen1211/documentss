FILE HANDLING		 

This file handling concept is very important part of web development. 

Python has several functions for creating and reading and updating and for deleting files. 

There are four different types of mode available. 

“r” - Read – Default value. 

Abc, “r’ 

Opens the file for reading it will throw an error if the file doesn’t exist. 

 

Print (f. Read ()) 

Read only part of the file. 

Example:  

F= open(“abc.txt”, “r”) 

Print (f.read(20)) 

Displays only first 20 characters. 

Print (f.readline()) 

 

“a” - append – open a file for appending, creating the file if it doesn’t exist. 

“w” - Write – opens a file for writing, creating the file if it doesn’t exist. 

Example: 

“x” - Create – creates a specified file, returns an error if the file is already existing. 

In addition to all the above specified modes, we have two handled modes,  

“txt” - Default value – text Mode. 

“v” - Binary mode.(e.g., Images) 

 

OPENING A FILE: This is a function to open a file. 

To open the file/ to open the function needs two parameter. 

File Name 

Hi Hello... Welcome to Cabptoid 

This is for testing the file handling concepts. 

We are undergoing for devops training. 

It's going smoother...! 

Mode 

Syntax 

Example: 

F=open (“ABC.txt”) 

Print (f. Read ()) 

Case: if the file is not in the same location. 

F = open (“D:// Files // abc.txt”, “r”) 

 

By looping through the lines of the file, you can read the whole file, line by line. 

 

Example: f= open (“abc.txt”,“r”) 

for x in f:  

print(x) 

 

CLOSING A FILE: 

To close a file after done with it. 

Example: f = open ( “abc.txt”, “r’) 

      Print ( f.read line ()) 

F.close() 

 

Writing to an already existing file: 

To write to an existing file you must add a parameter to the open function (). 

“a”: Add the new element at the end of the list. 

“w”; overwrite any existing content. 

 	F= open ( “abc.txt”, “a”) 

F= write (“I want to add new content”) 

F.close () 

Print (f. Read ()) 

 

CREATE A NEW FILE: 

T create a new file we use file open ( ) method, with any of the following combination: 

“X” - CREATE – It will create a new file, returns an error if the file exist. 

“a” - APPEND – It will create a file if the specified file doesn’t exist. 

“w’ - WRITE – It will create a file if the specified value doesn’t exist. 

Example:  

 f= open (“Demo.txt, “x”) 

 OUTPUT: A new empty file. 

 

DELETE A FILE: 

To delete a file, we must import the os module and run its command. 

Example:  

Import OS 

OS.remove (“Demo.txt, “x”) 

 

 

DELETING A FOLDER: 

Import OS  

OS.rmdir (“folder name”)
