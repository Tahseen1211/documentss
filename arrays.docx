ARRAY 

Arrays are mainly used to store multiple values in one single variable. 

Example: cars= [“Benz”, “ford”, “BMW”] 

Array: An Array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. 

Example:  

Car1= ‘Ford” 

Car2 = “BMW” 

Car3 = “Maruthi” 

Accessing the elements of an array: 

X = cars 0] 

 

Example: 

Cars = [“Benz”, “Ford”, “BMW”] 

X = cars [0] 

Print(x) 

To find the length of an array: 

Cars = [“Benz”, “Ford”, “BMW”] 

X = cars [0] 

Print(x) 

X = len(cars) 

Print(X) 

fruits=["apple","mango","orange","banana"] 
x=fruits[0] 
print(x) 
x=len(fruits) 
print(x) 

 

OUTPUT:

Looping array elements: 

Cars = [“Benz”, “Ford”, “BMW”] 

For x in cars 

Print(x) 

#looping array elements: 
fruits=["apple","mango","orange","banana"] 
for x in fruits: 
    print(x)

Adding element to an array; 

Append (): to add new element 

Cars = [“Benz”, “Ford”, “BMW”] 

Cars.append(“Honda”) 

Print (cars)

Cars.pop(1) 

Print(cars)
